## Inspiration💡

Remember the feeling of scribbling your thoughts, ideas, or even random doodles in your trusty old scrapbook? No rules, no pressure—just pure creativity. Blogging should feel the same way, but it often becomes a chore: planning, editing, and perfecting.

With Scratch Blogs, we’ve changed that. Now, blogging is as easy and free-flowing as jotting down notes in your scrapbook. Let your creativity take over, and we’ll handle the rest. Blog like you draw in your scratch book—effortless and fun.
What it does 💪

We offer an advanced editor that allows users to write text using Markdown, draw flowcharts or diagrams on the spot, and upload images seamlessly.

With this editor, users can create content, design diagrams, and much more. Additionally, after drawing a diagram, creating a flowchart, or uploading an image, they can simply click "Generate" to automatically create content based on their visuals.

## How we built it ❓🧠

- We used React and Typescript to built the Frontend and used express to build the Backend which is deployed on a Azure VM.
- We used Gemini AI to generate content based on the rough sketches the user draws on excalidraw and image they upload.
- We used the excalidraw npm package to integrating digital sketching.
- Design inspiration taken from : https://internal.rightfit.so/
